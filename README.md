# GestureControlðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤–
This is a machine learning project that involves controling your pc with hand gestures.
## Libraries:

**OpenCV:** used for real-time computer vision applications. It can access your webcam or video files.

**MediaPipe:** MediaPipe can detect and track hand landmarks (like finger joints and tips) in real-time from a video feed. That makes it ideal for gesture recognition.
 
**TensorFlow or PyTorch:** To train a classifier when building or running custom gesture recognition models.
 
**numpy & pandas:** Data handling.
 
**PyAutoGUI:** Control mouse and keyboard by bridging gesture recognition with actual system control (e.g., move cursor, click, scroll).
