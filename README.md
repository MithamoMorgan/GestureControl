# GestureControlðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤–
This is a machine learning project that involves controling your pc with hand gestures.
## Libraries:
1. **OpenCV** - used for real-time computer vision applications. It can access your webcam or video files.
2. **MediaPipe** - MediaPipe can detect and track hand landmarks (like finger joints and tips) in real-time from a video feed. That makes it ideal for gesture recognition.
3. **TensorFlow** - To train a classifier.
4. **numpy & pandas** - Data handling.
